# **Contributing to Classifai**

![Classifai Logo](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai/raw/v2_alpha/metadata/logo/Classifai_Logo_Horizontal_Dark.jpg)

Thank you for your interest in suggesting improvements to Classifai! We highly appreciated the help of collaborators across the world to join us in developing and improving the features and functionality of Classifai.

**Our goal is to continuously improve Classifai so that this open-source comprehensive data annotation software could make a huge impact on people/organizations who are doing projects and research in the field of artificial intelligence.**

Check out our repository [Classifai](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai) for more information on our latest versions and developments.

# Contribution Guidelines

We hope that our collaboration is discussed openly between our core development team and the community. The following steps serve as guidelines for collaborators to follow:

## **Check out current reported issues**

- This is the best way to get started on what kind of issues our team is facing. If contributors are interested in helping out our current issue, please comment your suggestion, notify us by @(a Classifai team member) and we will discuss how we can collaborate.

- It is also helpful if you can help us reproduce the reported issues too. As every trial and error experiment is important to signal to our current software development in identifying bugs and the possibility of reproducing the problem in different local machines.

## **Proposal by reporting an issue** 

- If a contributor has found an issue and wishes to solve it, please raise the issue and propose at <https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai/issues>. This is for us to check the validity of the issue and have a discussion on how we can implement the suggestion and design.

- Kindly supply us with your justification, motivation, and information as much as possible in your proposal by commenting on the raised issue.

- List of labels will be given to the reported issue as an indication of its importance and urgency.

## **State the scope of contribution**

- It is highly desired that contributors can describe or comment on which area or scope they are interested in to perform changes.

- Detailing the particulars is very important to let Classifai development team know the extent of modification such as code change or refractor to the source code so that we can determine the feasibility and workability of the solutions provided by the contributor.

## **Propose change to documentation**

- We are welcome collaborators to correct our mistakes in documentation if discovered, as well as propose changes to enrich our contents as we aim to produce a clear, correct, and complete document for future references of Classifai users.

## **Open a pull request**

- Collaborators are requested to perform testing on multiple case studies and scenarios, either suggested by us or provided by yours, in testing your solution toward a particular issue. This is important to ensure that after implementing changes to the software, it will still function in handling different cases.

- After successfully passing the unit testing, the contributor's coding is ready for review, please proceed with opening a pull request. We will assign core reviewers from our development team to have a detailed check on the provided solution.

- The checking process is expected to take a long time since there will be repeated debugging, code changing, and continuous integration testing. We will merge the pull request if the provided solution has been found to solve a particular problem and we will close the related issue.

- We reserved the right not to merge the pull request if we found the solution is not suitable.


# How to propose or report an issue

Collaborators can raise issues for bug reports and feature requests at [issue](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai/issues). Below listed all the requirements on how to do it properly.

## **Bug report**

- A clear title indicates the main problem
- A brief description of the bug
- Include screenshot or GIF if available
- Include the dataset if available
- Explain the observed behavior
- State the expected behavior
- State the steps to reproduce the errors
- State the OS used by the collaborator

## **Feature request**

- A clear title indicates the main problem
- Describe the encountered problem 
- Describe the feature or solution that you want to provide to eliminate the problem
- Describe the steps to produce the feature and solution
- Include samples pictures, GIF, or dataset if available
- State the OS used by the collaborator

# Submit your pull request

A warm reminder, kindly ensure that contributor's codes have passed all the unit testing, bug fixes and the targeted problem solved and not reproducible, then only proceed for team Classifai to review. This will save time for both parties to avoid going through a back and forth process for some avoidable minor problems.

Below are steps to assist your pull request:
- Fork [CertifaiAI/Classifai](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai) repository to your repository
- Create a new branch in your forked repository
```
    git checkout -b new-branch-name
```
- Check the current branch and make sure it is in a new branch
```
    git branch
```
- Add your codes to the new branch

```
    git add *
```
- Commit with a message, anything you want to inform us
```
    git commit -m "message"
```
- Push the commit to the repository
```
    git push -u origin new-branch-name
```
- Create pull request at GitHub

You did it! Thank you so much for your contribution. We are so appreciative of your help. Kindly wait for further notice while we are checking your codes. We will get back to you soon through email or comment at GitHub.
