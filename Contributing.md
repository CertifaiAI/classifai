![Classifai Logo](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai/raw/v2_alpha/metadata/logo/Classifai_Logo_Horizontal_Dark.jpg)

Thank you for your interest in suggesting improvement to Classifai! We are highly appreciated the help of collaborators across the World to join us developing and further improving the features and functionality of Classifai.

**Our goal is to continuously improving Classifai so that this open source comprehensive data annotation software could make huge impact to people/organization who doing projects and researches in the field of artificial intelligence.**

Check out our repository [Classifai](https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai) for more information on our latest versions and developments.

# Contribution Guidelines

We hope that our collaboration are discuss openly between our core development team and the community. The following steps serves as a guidelines for collaborators to follow:

## **Check out current reported issues**

- This is the best way to get started on what kind of issues our team are facing with. If contributor interested in helping out our current issue, please comment your suggestion, notify us by @(a Classifai team member) and we will discuss how we can collaborate.

- It is also helpful if you can help us reproduce the reported issues too. As every trial and error experiments are important signals to our current software development in identifying bugs and possibility in reproducing the problem in different local machine.

## **Proposal by reporting an issue** 

- If a contributor has found an issue and wish to solve it, please raise the issue and propose at <https://github.com/CertifaiAI/classifai/issues>. This is for us to check the validity of the issue and have discussion on how we can implement the suggestion and design.

- Kindly supply us your justification, motivation and information as much as possible in your proposal by commenting in the raised issue.

- List of labels will be given to the reported issue as an indication of its importance and urgency.

## **State the scope of contribution**

- It is highly desired that contributors can describe or comment which area or scope they are interested to perform changes.

- Detailing the particulars is very important to let Classifai development team know the extent of modification such as code change or refractor to the source code so that we can determine the feasibility and workability of the solutions provided by contributor.

## **Propose change to documentation**

- We are welcome collaborators to correct our mistake in documentation, if discovered, as well as propose changes to enrich our contents as we are aim to produce a clear, correct and complete document for future references of Classifai users.

## **Open a pull request**

- Collaborators are requested to perform multiple case studies and scenarios, either suggested by us or provided by yours, in testing your solution toward a particular issue. This is important to ensure that after implemented changes to the software, it will still functionable in handling different cases.

- After successfully pass the unit testing, the contributor's coding is ready for review, please proceed with opening a pull request. We will assign core reviewers from our development team to have a detail check on contributor provided solution.

- The checking process is expected to take long time, because there will be repeated debugging, code changing and continuous integration testing are required. We will merge the pull request if the provided solution has been found able to solve a particular problem and we will close the related issue.

- We reserved the right not to merge the pull request if we found the solution is not suitable.


# How to propose or report an issue

- State the OS used by collaborator

# Submit your pull request

A warm reminder, kindly ensure that contributor's codes have passed all the unit testing, bug fixes and the targeted problem solved and not reproduceable, then only proceed for team Classifai to review. This will save time for both parties to avoid going through back and forth process for some avoidable minor problems.
